# dogs_vs_cats

Image classification is the fundation of computer vision. In this repo, I will use several approaches to train a variety of image classification models to solve dogs vs cats challenges on Kaggle.

## 1. build a convelutional neural network from scratch

## 2. transfer learning using pre-trained model
### Xception
### InceptionV3
### NASNetLarge

## 3. feature vectore extraction
